                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <P id="overviewP"> I will be creating a low poly character for a computer game. This includes the
                    modelling the
                    character and rigging it. We rig it so we could produce different animations for when they're idle
                    or
                    running. The character will have 11 parts; forearm and brachium for both sides (4), the calf and
                    quads for both legs (4), torso, neck and head.
                    <br>
                    My specific character will be a male assasin, requiring a cloak and dagger. These are additions to
                    my design. It will take heavy inspiration from the assasins creed games.

            <P id="end-usersP" class="width"> The target audience for these cloak designs consists of game developers
                specializing in action-adventure games with characters adept in stealth mechanics. These developers
                primarily target male gamers between the ages of 14 and 25, as this demographic represents the
                consumer base for such games. Understanding the preferences and expectations of their audience, these
                developers seek cloak designs that resonate with the visual style and narrative themes of their games.
                They value flexibility in design to accommodate potential shape changes or game changes, to align with
                evolving gameplay mechanics and aesthetic preferences of not only tjem, but the target audience aswell.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed for swift and silent movement, the calf and quad should feature streamlined shapes
                            to minimize noise and friction against surfaces.</li>
                        <li>Shoes should have a sleek, low-profile design with textured soles for enhanced traction and
                            stability.</li>
                        <li>Rigging should enable realistic flexion and extension of the legs, with special attention to
                            the ankle joint for dynamic foot movements. 3 rigging joint (calf, quad and foot)</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The torso serves as the central hub for character movement and interaction, requiring a
                            sturdy yet flexible design to support various actions.</li>
                        <li>The capelet attached to the shoulders should have fluid cloth physics, allowing it to react
                            dynamically to character movements and environmental factors.</li>
                        <li>A functional belt with intricately detailed buckles and pouches adds visual interest and

                    <ul>
                        <li>Arms should be modeled with defined musculature and realistic proportions to convey strength
                            and agility.</li>
                        <li>The humerus and forearm should feature smooth transitions between segments, facilitating
                            fluid movement and posing.</li>
                        <li>2 rigging joints, upper arm and forearm (connected by elbow)</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The cloaked head should exude an air of mystery and intrigue, with the cloak draping
                            elegantly over the shoulders and framing the face.</li>
                        <li>Eyes should be expressive and lifelike, capable of conveying a wide range of emotions and
                            reactions to make up for the character not having a mouth.</li>
                        <li>Neck rigging should allow for smooth rotation and tilting movements, enhancing the
                            character's believability and expressiveness.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The cloak should have a flowing silhouette with subtle texture details, conveying a sense of
                            weight and movement as the character navigates the environment (It wont be rigged this is
                            specific to design).</li>
                        <li>Designed to provide camouflage and protection, the cloak should feature muted colors and
                            naturalistic patterns that blend seamlessly with the surroundings.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    <h3>Rigging</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rigging is essential for bringing the character to life through animation, allowing for
                            realistic movement and interaction with the game world.</li>
                        <li>Each component, including the head, legs, arms, and neck, should be meticulously rigged to
                            enable seamless articulation and posing.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Animation should emphasize the character's agility and stealth, with fluid movements that
                            reflect their swift and precise actions.</li>
                        <li>Running animations should convey speed and grace, with subtle secondary motions in the
                            capelet and cloak to enhance realism.</li>
                        <li>Idle animations should capture the character's focused demeanor, with occasional shifts in
                            weight and subtle gestures to maintain engagement.</li>

            <h1 id="aestheticsP">Aesthetics</h1>
            <h3>What Are aesthetics?</h3>
            <p>The definition of 'aesthetic' is 'concerned with beauty or the appreciation of beauty'. In the case it's
                how visually pleasing the character is. If a character with arms three times the size of its legs, they
                wouldnt be very aestheticly pleasing.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>I address this by...</h3>
            <p>There are plenty of models out there and hundreds of templates, if I use one lf those templates to get my
                proportions right this issue will be adressed for the aesthetics of my character. I will cover the
                'intellectual-property' aspect of this
                later.</p>


            <br>
            <h1>Functionality</h1>
            <h3>What is functionality?</h3>
            <p id="functionalityP">Functionality is defined by how functional a project is, meaning if certain
                animations are designs for
                legs and hand work </p>
            <br>
            <h3>I address this by...</h3>
            <p>Testing & feedback. Sometimes peolpe are blind to their own faults so testing amnd feedback from people
                who understand what I need to change is one of, if not the most important thing fo this implication
            </p>

            <br>
            <h1 id="usabilityP">Usability</h1>
            <h3>What is usability?</h3>
            <p>Usibility is best defined by how easy a it would be for a random person who knows nothing about the
                project to use it effortlessly. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>I address this by...</h3>
            <p>The design of character should be clear on what its made to do and how it could be used. Rigginf for
                animation is the mian player for this one as to show how to could be used it needs to be able to move.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h1 id="accessibilityP">Accessibility</h1>
            <h3>What is accessibility?</h3>
            <p>In this context it means if our project is accesible to people with disabilities. Certain things like
                epilepsy could be triggered if our movements is too eratic.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>I address this by...</h3>
            <p>reducing certain triggering animation like very fast movements, or fast transitions. Another way is
                simply by
                smoothing out the animations or even slowing them down. </p>

            <br>
            <h1 id="future-proofingP">Future-proofing</h1>
            <h3>What is Future-proofing?</h3>
            <p>3D models are a relativly new part of cgi and games. Compared to ten years ago the amount of detail in
                characters is insane, therefore future-proofing a project which could be like pixel art in a year is
                difficult.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>I address this by...</h3>
            <p>This particular implication does not apply to this portfolio</p>

            <h1 id="legalP">Legal</h1>
            <h3>What is Legal?</h3>
            <p>This is usually refering to products. It could be looped in with intellectual-property which is next.</p>

            <br>







            <h1 id="intellectual-propertyP">Intellectual-Property</h1>
            <h3>What is intellectual-Property?</h3>
            <p>Intellectual-Property refers to the ownerships of certain things like photos or designs. If we use
                somebody elses design without the proper licensing or crediting that's considered plagiarism and is not
                legal.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>I address this by...</h3>
            <p>
                Crafting original designs is a necesary part of the creative process. By sticking to designs made by me,
                we ensure my work is free from plagiarism and completly authentic. This commitment
                not only shows ethics but also innovation. Originality serves as my
                guiding principle in any project, as it should.</p>
