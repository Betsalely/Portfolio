                In making my low poly character's head, I focused on building its shape using basic shapes like
                triangles and squares. I shaped each part, like the face and the smaller features such as the eyes and
                mouth(covered by a mask). imagine it like making a character with digital clay, except the clay
                is blocky. Although I didn't add colors, I still paid close attention to details to make sure the
                character looked realistic and interesting while maintaining the low poly design. </div>
