                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <P id="overviewP">We are going to be making a graphic flappy bird game in python using the pygame module
                    in python. Flappy bird is a hard game to make but easy to play. Only two choices at any given time;
                    jump or don’t jump. The complex part of making it lies in the aesthetics and functionality of the
                    game. The group's objective is to make a flappy bird game that looks good, allows a player to keep
                    track of their score and is fun to play. This means things like obstacles that move, time and a
                    score counter will need to be added.

            <h2>End Users</h2>
            <P id="end-usersP" class="width"> The end users for our project will mainly be students and you adults
                (teenagers). Teenagers often look for fun games, and while some more intense gamers might enjoy games
                like elden ring, simple games like flappy bird always have an audience. A very important aspect of
                videogames is how much a player enjoys playing the game without it being impossibl;e. Teenagers can get
                frustrated so to appeal to our audience we have to make a game with complexity that can also be played
                by their 11 year old brother and their 84 year old grandfather. Other than difficulty, aesthetics are a
                great way to keep players engaged so bright colors will interest teenagers.

            <h1>Aesthetics</h1>
            <h3>What Are aesthetics?</h3>
            <p>The definition of 'aesthetic' is 'concerned with beauty or the appreciation of beauty'. In the case it's
                how visually pleasing the game is. If a game has a b unhc of really bright colours and a terrible c
                haracter design the game will seem low quality.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="aestheticsP">I address this by...</h3>
            <p>Colors that pop out of the screen are key to graphical games. We want to try and stick to some of the
                original colors of the game while adding our own touches. For example the background will still be blue,
                and the player still yellow, but the obstacles that kill you are red now. The floor is red with a
                gradient to black because we want to be able to see the floor moving. If the floor moves it looks like
                the player is moving more than if just the columns are moving. Despite having access to all these
                beautiful colors one limiting aspect of the way the game is made is that we can only use a certain
                number of ‘pixels’. The more detailed we make it the harder it is to run the program, so rather than
                make a super detailed player a yellow square that moves up and down will suffice.
            </p>


            <br>
            <h1>Functionality</h1>
            <h3>What is functionality?</h3>
            <p>Functionality is defined by how functional a project is, meaning if certain function
                do what they're supposed to like if death detection is accurate </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="functionalityP">I address this by...</h3>
            <p>Testing, testing and more testing. the only way to determine if everything works is by doing EVERYTHING.
                Trying to do every action a player could possibly take. Wether they try and escape the map or die
                instantly everything should work.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h1>Usability</h1>
            <h3>What is usability?</h3>
            <p>Usibility is best defined by how easy a it would be for a random person who knows nothing about the
                project to use it effortlessly. </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="usabilityP">I address this by...</h3>
            <p>Simplicity of the controls. Flappy bird is great in the way that a player can only make one of two
                choices
                at any given point. Either they jump or don't. A space bar is quite universally known to be used as the
                jump button but even so, a menu with instruction would be helpful.
            </p>

            <br>



            <h1>Health and Safety</h1>
            <h3>What is health and safety?</h3>
            <p>Health and safety refers to my project bein safe to use for all people and if it endangers people with
                certain disabilities.</p>
            <br>
